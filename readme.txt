HUFFMAN ENCODING

The program reads a text file and encodes it using huffman algorithm.
The program can also decode the file back to the original data.
By default the file name for textual data is input.txt. 
A sample input file is attached for your reference.
You may change the name of the input file. 
Encoded file and decoded file is saved as encode_file and decode_file respectively.

No external libraries needed to run the project.

*IMPORTANT NOTE*
This is only the backhand command line code. I have also coded a GUI Application that lets you choose
your file from anywhere in the PC to zip or unzip. However the GUI Interface is coded using the QT API 
which is a very heavy API to install so I have not sent the code for GUI Interface. I  will run the full
application during the project VIVA.
